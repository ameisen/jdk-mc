the Field class no longer has any fields according to reflection. This appears to have changed at some point, it is not a bug in our build.
Two approaches to fixing this:
	oop Reflection::new_field(fieldDescriptor* fd, TRAPS) et al
	OR
	fake Field subclass that talks to setters/getters in the Field, and override it in getDeclaredFields.
